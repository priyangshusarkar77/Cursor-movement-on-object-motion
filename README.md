This project is about controlling the cursor movement using the hand gestures and motion. The hand is tracked using a webcam and by using libraries like 
Mediapipe and OpenCV. By this project we can replace the traditional mouse and keyboard system. This project proposes a novel vision-based cursor control system, using hand gestures captured from a webcam. Like in sci-fi movies we saw how hologram technology can be used to make information touch free, but in reality, we are 
not close to this technology. Our project acts as a bridge between the hologram 3-d technology and the traditional mouse system. In this project the system will 
allow the user to navigate the computer cursor using their hand and cursor functions, such as right and left clicks, will be performed using different hand 
gestures.
